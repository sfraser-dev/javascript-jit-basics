# Various Challenges

## Variables

1. Create a variable that stores your name and log a string to the console that persoanlly greets you using template literals.
1. Create variables storing your name, your favourite color and your favourite film or tv series. Using template literals I want you to log a sentence including these values to the console.
1. Create variables storing what you ate for breakfast, lunch and dinner yesterday and log them to the console. Without redelcaring new variables I would like you to asign a new value of what you ate today to the variables, and again log them to the console.

## If Statements

1. Write a program that checks whether a customer is old enough to be served alcohol at a bar. Declare a variable called age and write an if statement that checks whether age is 18 or above. If age is less than 18 log "Sorry, I can't serve you" to the console, if age is 18 or above log "No problem, what would you like to drink?"
1. Declare a variable called "Password". Write an if statement that checks how many characters are in the password, if the password has more than 8 characters log the password to the console, if the password has less than 8 characters log to the console that the password is too short.
1. Create a variable that stores a number. Check whether the number is divisible by 3 or 5, if so log "This number is divisible by 3 or 5" to the console. Otherwise log an alternate message to the console.
1. Create a variable that stores a number. If the number is divisible by 3, if so log "fizz" to the console. If the number is divisible by 5 log "buzz" to the console. If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, log "fizz buzz" to the console. Otherwise log the number to the console.

## Loops and Arrays

1. Create an array of your favourite films / TV shows, up to 5 items. Use an array method to add 2 more items to your array. Use a loop to cycle through the array and log each item to the console.
1. Generate 10 random numbers between 1-100 and log them to the console.
1. Create a loop that counts backwards from 20-0.
1. Generate 5 random numbers between 1-50. For each number generated, check if the number is divisible by 5 or not. Log whether it is divisible or not to the console.

## Functions

1. Write a function that takes in your name as an argument and logs a personalised greeting to you in the console.
1. Write a function that takes in a number as an argument and check whether it is odd or even and logs the result to the console.
1. ATM function (explained during the session). ATM Challenge Requirements:
    - Your function must take in a pin number and an amount to withdraw.
    - The pin number argument must be checked against a stored pin number and the withdrawal amount must be checked against a stored account balance.
    - If the pin matches and the withdrawal amount is less than the account balance the transaction should be approved. If the pin is wrong or the balance is not sufficient, decline the transaction.

## Objects and Methods

1. Create an object called ‘person’ with keys of name age and city. Add a method to the person object that greets the person using their name.
1. Without amending the original object I would like you to add an array of your favourite films to the person object. I would like you to then add a method to your object that returns a sentence stating the persons ‘name’, ‘age’ , ‘city’ and one of their favourite films.
1. Create an object that contains an Object nested within it and practice accessing different data from the object.
